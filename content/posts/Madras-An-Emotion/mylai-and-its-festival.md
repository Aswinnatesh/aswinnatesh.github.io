##### `Mylapore Festival`
All great cities have a soul. Mylapore can rightfully claim to be the soul of Chennai (Madras) city here in south India. It pre-dates Chennaiâ€™s birth in the 17th cent. and has seen the city grow as it has, its own. Mylapore retains the look and feel of an old neighborhood, the culture and heritage typically south Indian, yet it has not escaped development. This place that is proud of its arts, culture and tradition and people is just the setting for a cultural festival. A festival held in its very heart and around a great temple. Held every year in early January.
