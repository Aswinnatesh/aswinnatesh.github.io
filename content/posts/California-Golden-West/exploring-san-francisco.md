#####  `Exploring San Francisco!`

I'm very excited about this 5-minute video about my favorite city to explore "San Francisco"! This video was filmed around 2019 Christmas over a few biking day trips covering ~50 miles. I hope you are just as excited as I am for this video and thanks for watching!
